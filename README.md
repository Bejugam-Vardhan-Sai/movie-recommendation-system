Analyzing the Original Text

I've begun analyzing the original text, breaking it down to understand its structure and content. My focus is on identifying sections ripe for paraphrasing or complete rewrites to eliminate any plagiarism concerns. I am carefully documenting each section, making note of key phrases and ideas I need to address.

Deconstructing the Framework

I'm now fully immersed in deconstructing the framework. My immediate focus is on re-articulating the features section. Instead of a straightforward bullet-point list, I plan to integrate each feature description into a more fluid narrative, emphasizing the user-friendly aspects of this movie recommendation system. My goal is to maintain the original intent while introducing a fresh perspective and style of writing.

Developing New Perspectives

I'm now focusing on rewriting the "How It Works" section, particularly the step-by-step technical explanations. I'm exploring narrative styles to ensure accuracy while providing clarity, avoiding direct repetition of the original language. This involves restructuring the order of steps and incorporating concise, technical explanations for non-technical users. My goal is to make the process more accessible without sacrificing precision.

Formulating New Explanations

I'm now focusing on a complete rewrite of the "How It Works" section. Instead of a straightforward listing, I aim for a narrative explanation. I'll describe data preprocessing and vectorization, then illustrate cosine similarity and the user interaction flow in the app. I'm prioritizing clarity for non-technical users while maintaining accuracy. I'll use simple language and varied sentence structures. My intent is to replace the original step-by-step technicalities with clearer descriptions.

Formulating a Revision Strategy

I've formulated a complete revision strategy, dissecting the original text into its key components. My plan includes an introduction rewrite, feature rephrasing, and a structured "How It Works" narrative. I will also make the running instructions and file structure more accessible and user-friendly by restructuring them.

Developing the New Narrative

I've initiated the rewrite of the introduction and features sections, opting for a narrative-driven approach. The goal is to provide a more engaging and accessible explanation, highlighting the system's ease of use and core functionalities. I'm focusing on incorporating the technical details in a more integrated manner rather than presenting them as a list. I'm also ensuring the technical accuracy remains intact.

Of course! Here is a rewritten version of the project description, rephrased to be original and clear.

This project is a movie recommendation engine that uses content-based filtering to suggest films similar to a user's selection. Built with Python and Streamlit, it provides a simple yet effective way to discover new movies.

‚ú® Key Features
Smart Recommendations: Suggests movies by analyzing shared attributes like plot summaries, genres, keywords, cast members, and directors.

User-Friendly Interface: A clean and interactive web app built with Streamlit for an intuitive user experience.

High-Speed Performance: Utilizes a pre-calculated cosine similarity matrix to deliver recommendations almost instantly.

Easy to Update: The recommendation model can be refreshed with an updated dataset by re-running a single Python script.

üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
The recommendation system is powered by a content-based filtering approach, which involves several key steps:

Data Preparation (movie_code.py): The process starts by loading the movie dataset. Key textual information such as overview, genres, keywords, cast, and director is merged into a single text block called tags for each movie. This tags field is then standardized by converting it to lowercase and applying stemming (e.g., reducing "love," "loving," and "loved" to the root word "love") using the NLTK library.

Text Vectorization: The textual tags are converted into numerical vectors. This is achieved using Scikit-learn's CountVectorizer, which creates a matrix based on the frequency of the top 5,000 most common words across all movie tags. Each movie is now represented as a vector in a high-dimensional space.

Similarity Measurement: The cosine similarity is calculated between every pair of movie vectors. This metric measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, with a value closer to 1 indicating a higher degree of similarity. The result is a comprehensive similarity matrix.

Making a Recommendation (app.py): The Streamlit application loads the processed movie data and the pre-computed similarity matrix. When a user selects a movie title from the dropdown, the system finds its corresponding entry in the similarity matrix. It then sorts the similarity scores and presents the top 5 movies with the highest scores as recommendations.


üöÄ  Running the Project Locally
Follow these instructions to get the project running on your own machine.

What You'll Need:

Python 3.8 or newer

The pip package installer

1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and run the following commands:

Bash

git clone https:https://github.com/Bejugam-Vardhan-Sai/movie-recommendation-system
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

(Bash)
# On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS or Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Required Libraries
Create a file named requirements.txt with the necessary packages and install them using pip:

(Bash)
pip install -r requirements.txt
You also need to download a tokenizer from the NLTK library. Open a Python interpreter and run:

(Python)
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
4. Get the Dataset
This project requires the movie_dataset.csv file. Place it in the project's root directory.

Pro Tip: Your script movie_code.py might have a hardcoded file path (e.g., D:/.../movie_dataset.csv). It's best to change this to a relative path like movie_dataset.csv to ensure it works on any computer.

5. Generate the Model Files
Run the data processing script from your terminal. This will create the movie_pkl.pkl and similarity_matrix.pkl files needed by the app.

(Bash)
python movie_code.py
6. Launch the Streamlit App
With the model files generated, you can now start the application:

(Bash)
streamlit run app.py
The application should automatically open in your web browser, typically at http://localhost:8501.
